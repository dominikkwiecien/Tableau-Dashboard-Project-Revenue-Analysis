# Tableau Dashboard Project: Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved the creation of an insightful and interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze the company's revenue streams, focusing on total revenue, paid user counts, and average revenue per paid user (ARPPU). The dashboard includes multiple visualizations that allow for detailed analysis across various dimensions, such as product categories and geographical locations.

### Key Metrics Calculated:
1. **Total Revenue:** The cumulative revenue generated by the company across different products and locations.
2. **Paid Users Count:** The number of users who have made payments within a specified period.
3. **Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU):** A metric that calculates the average revenue generated per paying user.

### Visualizations Included:
1. **Total Revenue by Location and Product:**
   - A bar chart visualizing the total revenue generated by different products across various geographical locations (APAC, EMEA, USA).

2. **Total Revenue by Location:**
   - A bar chart comparing the total revenue generated in each location, providing a clear view of which regions contribute the most to overall revenue.

3. **Monthly Revenue Trends by Product:**
   - A line chart that tracks monthly revenue trends for each product, allowing for an understanding of seasonal variations and performance fluctuations.

4. **Monthly Paid Users and Average Revenue Per User (ARPPU) Analysis:**
   - A combined bar and line chart that shows the relationship between the number of paid users and the average revenue per user over time.

5. **Total Cash Inflows for Individual Company Products:**
   - A pie chart displaying the distribution of total revenue among the company's various products.

### Dashboard Features:
- **Interactive Filters:**
  - Filters for Location, Product, and Payment Date are integrated, allowing users to dynamically explore the data across multiple dimensions.
